## About The Project

**Weave** is a powerful and intuitive Chrome extension designed to make full-page screen captures effortless and accurate. Gone are the days of manually scrolling, taking multiple screenshots, and painstakingly stitching them together. Weave automates the entire process, intelligently scrolling through a webpage, capturing every section, and weaving them into a single, pixel-perfect image.

Built with modern web technologies, Weave is lightweight, fast, and privacy-focused. It runs entirely in your browser, ensuring your captured data remains secure. Whether you're a designer saving inspiration, a developer debugging a layout, or anyone needing to archive a full webpage, Weave is the perfect tool for the job.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **üìú True Full-Page Capture:** Weave automatically scrolls the entire page, capturing and stitching each visible section to create one continuous, high-resolution image.

*   **üß† Smart Element Handling:** Intelligently detects and handles sticky headers, footers, and other fixed-position elements to prevent them from appearing multiple times in your final screenshot.

*   **üöÄ Flexible Workflow Actions:** Choose what happens the moment your screenshot is ready. Configure your default action in the settings for a workflow that fits your needs.
    *   **Open in Viewer:** Instantly preview your screenshot in a clean, dedicated viewer tab.
    *   **Direct Download:** Save the image directly to your downloads folder.
    *   **Copy to Clipboard:** Copy the screenshot to your clipboard for immediate pasting.

*   **üñºÔ∏è Instant Preview & Action Hub**
    The beautiful built-in viewer lets you inspect your capture and decide what to do next. The interface is clean, responsive, and supports both light and dark modes.
